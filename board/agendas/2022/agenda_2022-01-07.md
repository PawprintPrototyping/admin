    - [ ] Liability Waivers (Need to have a real law person look at it)
    - [x] Bank Account (Created, functional, but need to go in-person to iron out some other details)
    - [ ] Dues billing (We have a Stripe account but it isn't linked to our bank, but is linked to MemberMatters)

    - [ ] Personal storage space (proposed: small lockers for PPE) (Not ready; not blocking launch)
    - [ ] Membership add-ons (No tiers, only add-ons)

### Infrastructure
- Fanvil Update
  - Would like to get up and running prior to or at opening, if possible
  - Still need to get to where cards can operate the deadbolt (Rechner)
  - Maglock for interior door needs installing (Tane)
  - Need to repair the fanvil front fascia
- Membership software

  - Can enroll and be linked in the back
- Front Door Replacement Update
    - The autoclosers confuse Kataze, actually
- The Wall/Roof/Door
  - This is going to be very cool, it is probably also going to take a while
  - Make door push in and then slide sideways (Tane thinks there's some kind of bathroom rail thing)
- Need to install more outlets
  - Maybe one more for the compressor (possibly when we upgrade)
  - Need to scope out location and amperage (Back wall and enclosed room)
- Sink/Shower
  - Sink seems fine, shower drain needs attention (need a bigger drain/hole, still leaks a bit)
  - Anchor to the wall

  - There is one smoke detector connected now, in the office; more to be ordered
  - Homeassistant to be spun up and linked to smoke detectors
