# Board Meeting Agenda January 26, 2026

## Attendees

### Space Management

#### Board Member Burnout
- Currently, board members handle the majority of events and space upkeep in addition to their board responsibilities.
- This is unsustainable. We are tired. We need help.
- The need for help has been discussed among the board, and with individuals, but broad messaging has not occurred.
- What could community members do to help?
  - Host classes/workshops.
  - Help with space cleanliness.
  - Update information on the wiki.
  - ?

#### Space switch report
- These metrics have been great lately, 47 - 50h of open time to the public per week by members.

#### Tech
- We have submitted to the ICANN gTLD Applicant Support Program. Still waiting to hear back.
- We have a new wiki system that is hopefully more approachable for people who are not Very Computer.  Some people are making edits.
- Membership roster rearrangement?
- Service access and ownership audit?
  - We need an inventory before we can audit it. What services do we have/use?
- New events platform at https://events.pawprintprototyping.org - I'd like to phase out use of the Google calendar for events in favor of this.
