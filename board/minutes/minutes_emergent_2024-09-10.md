# Emergency Pawprint Board Meeting

# What is happening
- The FTB has sent us a formal legal demand that the corporation file all past due returns, which we have done. Got the letter for this in June 19th 2024 (notice date, we got it June 24th)
- We missed 2020, 8 months worth (april to december). Kataze filed this with them recently with a 199N EPostcard to the FTB. Got confirmation
- August 30th we got a note that we should file all past due returns and pay all tax. Does not mention a specific filing year. Penalty is 5% of the unpaid tax, but we don't owe any. 
- August 30th we got yet another letter that says we need to file and pay all taxes. It says we owe $0, which means they have not recieved taxes. This is wrong, because we filed them
- Kay says to FTB: We got these letters which say we don't owe any money, calls FTB Tuesday September 3rd. Informed that the number on the form we got was wrong and that department had closed for the day.
- Kay calls the FTB again on September 4th, FTB looks at our account and says that we haven't filed with them at all, we need to file a 3500A form.  Priority mailed 3500A thursday, arrived monday.  
- Call FTB again and FTB rep advises the 3500A takes 9 months to process and we will have our exemption revoked.  FTB advises to send letter revoking 3500A and submit 3500 with supporting documents (bylaws, lease agreement), mailed that Today.

- Form seems to say that we are in trouble for our tax deliquency, which seems to not be the case. 
- We also appear to be in trouble because we never filed a 3500 or 3500A when we incorporated.

# What are the risks
- As written, we lose the write to conduct business, a bunch of stuff, and use your entities name. 
- We are most concerned about "conduct business activities". What does that mean????
- Rechner and Kataze are reaching out to lawyer friends. 
- Rechner got a response from Red, asked some questions, no clear answers. "sticky wicket"
- BACH someone reacted with a ghost emoji to our question
- Not really sure about the risks
- State entity may reach out to other state entities and screw us. 
- We don't really "do business"

# What are the next steps
- General feeling is until someone else says otherwise, we should keep trying to resolve this but continue to collect dues. 
- Stop when someone tries to freeze our bank account or the cops show up
- Sellers permit are gone for sure, but we don't really care.
- absolutely tell the membership
- should we halt benevity? No, it's not really "doing business", those are donations
- Kay will follow up with FTB

Overall:
- Keep working at this, don't do anything drastic.

FTB questions
- Expedited processing. Get real concrete details on what is needed. What is the timeline on expidited process
- Make them define what "doing business" is.
- Will we be liable for taxes if we lose our status this year?
- Why are we just hearing about this now? We have been filing taxes for 5 years
- Since we are trying to resolve this, can you not revoke us please? :bottom fingers:
- Do we get any feedback during this process? Is there a website we can check? Do we just keep calling you?
