# Board Meeting Agenda January 7th, 2021
## Attendees
- Kataze, Amp, Timber, Rechner

### Discussion
- Post Pandemic Pawprint (PPP)
  - January 2022 opening plan
    - Not anticipating opening this month due to Covid:Omicron
    - Not enough information at this point to provide an estimated new opening date
  - Showing as Open on Google; business hours listed as 'Closed' every day
    - Makes sense to leave as 'Closed' for now, also don't hold regular business hours/availability
    - To revisit later
  - What do we need to open?
    - [x] Membership agreement draft already on the books [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SWPpZvJvQzU8xjn52bWUc_9ROyN5fLHoaM5hWmdEbAc/edit?usp=sharing)
    - [ ] Membership Handbook
    - [ ] Liability Waivers (Need to have a real law person look at it)
    - [x] Bank Account (Created, functional, but need to go in-person to iron out some other details)
    - [ ] Dues billing (We have a Stripe account but it isn't linked to our bank, but is linked to MemberMatters)
    - [ ] Membership Software ([MemberMatters](https://members.pawprintprototyping.org/)) (Need to set up accounts)
    - [x] Physical space organization and cleanup (Laser cutter and workbench in their new homes but needs cleanup) Proposed for 17 Nov
    - [ ] Establish policies revolving around tool and asset usage (Steal from NoVa Labs?)
        - [ ] Rechner to start a spreadsheet of tools and their access ratings
        - [ ] Onboarding and training
    - [x] Policy revolving around vaccination (Required. No exemptions)
    - [x] Tane to check Cal-OSHA requirements (machine guarding - no need to have, COVID-19)
    - [ ] PPE procurement and policies (Offer them as part of membership - everyone gets their own)
    - [ ] Personal storage space (proposed: small lockers for PPE) (Not ready; not blocking launch)
    - [ ] Membership add-ons (No tiers, only add-ons)
    - [x] insurance update (we talked with state farm and they're amicable, but we might be better off with a bespoke policy)
    - [ ] Fanvil deadbolt operation (NN submit a ticket as the firmware lacks the promised ONVIF server)
    - [ ] Membership card design
    - [ ] Need mifare stock for the cards, as well as at least one roll of ribbon
    - [ ] Sick labcoats for board members Order arrived; try on)
    - [ ] Anchor shower
    - [x] Fire Extinguishers
- Laser Cutter Setup
  - NUC now in place, could use a more permanent home (cart or wall mount)
- Need to begin 2021 taxes; Kataze to provide Amp with paperwork

### Infrastructure
- Fanvil Update
  - Would like to get up and running prior to or at opening, if possible
  - Still need to get to where cards can operate the deadbolt (Rechner)
  - Maglock for interior door needs installing (Tane) (Not a blocker; still need to discuss control system)
  - Need to repair the fanvil front fascia (isn't made correctly - need to oversize the button thru hole)
- Membership software
  - Instance spun up on our servers - https://members.pawprintprototyping.org/login
  - Can enroll and be linked in the back
- Front Door Replacement Update
    - The autoclosers confuse Kataze, actually
- The Wall/Roof/Door
  - This is going to be very cool, it is probably also going to take a while
  - Make door push in and then slide sideways (Tane thinks there's some kind of bathroom rail thing)
- Need to install more outlets
  - Maybe one more for the compressor (possibly when we upgrade)
  - Need to scope out location and amperage (Back wall and enclosed room)
- Sink/Shower
  - Sink seems fine, shower drain needs attention (need a bigger drain/hole, still leaks a bit)
  - Anchor to the wall
- Fire detection and alarm system not currently active
  - There is one smoke detector connected now, in the office; 2 more ordered, need to be installed
  - Homeassistant to be spun up and linked to smoke detectors
