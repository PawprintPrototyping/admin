    - [ ] Liability Waivers ([example here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_AZNiR7fup9Y7YqbHt2NaG50egEzIu3R/view?usp=sharing), need to have a real lawyer look at it)

    - [ ] Personal storage space (proposed: small lockers for PPE) (Not ready; not blocking launch)
    - [ ] Membership add-ons (No tiers, only add-ons)

### Infrastructure
- Cameras

  - One is slated for outdoors, and the other for the entryway
  - Euro Paddock was requesting an outdoor camera for the parking lot
  - Xprotect is running on a limited loop; needs to set up for users
- Fanvil Update
  - Would like to get up and running prior to or at opening, if possible
  - Still need to get to where cards can operate the deadbolt (Rechner)
  - Maglock for interior door needs installing (Tane) (Not a blocker; still need to discuss control system)
  - Need to repair the fanvil front fascia (isn't made correctly - need to oversize the button thru hole)

  - Can enroll and be linked in the back

  - Amp to look into nonprofit pricing on Xero, but currently only on a one-month free trial. Rechner to turn off until we have members.
  - Plan for March for turning on dues
- Front Door Replacement Update
    - The autoclosers confuse Kataze, actually
- The Wall/Roof/Door
  - This is going to be very cool, it is probably also going to take a while

- Need to install more outlets
  - Maybe one more for the compressor (possibly when we upgrade)
