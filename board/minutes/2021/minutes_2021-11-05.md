    - STILL need to tension autoclosers (slated for today)
- The Wall/Roof/Door
  - This is going to be very cool, it is probably also going to take a while
  - Make door push in and then slide sideways (Tane thinks there's some kind of bathroom rail thing)
- Need to install more outlets
  - Maybe one more for the compressor (possibly when we upgrade)
