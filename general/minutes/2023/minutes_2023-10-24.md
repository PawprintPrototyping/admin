- Mojake minute:  The two prussa Mk3's have been firmware downgraded to fix an axis
crash and/or thermal anomaly, please do not update them.  Maslo has been given up
on. It operates but is wildly inaccurate Â±5mm.  There's a new one, it's more rigid
and belt driven and could be way better.  Open for hacking.

- Door controller should be more reliable now.  We have a new super skookem Assa door
latch replacement which will be great once we convince a real life contractor to come
anchor that into the concrete.

- Also WiFi will be improved to make the August happier.

- Don't put anything in front of the heater that will blow away/up.
